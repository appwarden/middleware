## Security Measures

This package implements several security measures:

1. **npm Provenance**: All published packages include npm provenance, providing a verifiable link between the published package and its source code.

2. **Dependency Scanning**: We regularly scan dependencies for vulnerabilities and update them as needed.

3. **Code Scanning**: We use GitHub CodeQL to scan for potential security issues in our codebase.

4. **Secure Development Practices**: We follow secure coding practices and conduct code reviews with security in mind.

## Third-Party Libraries

This project depends on third-party libraries that may have their own security policies. We make an effort to keep these dependencies up to date, but we recommend reviewing the security policies of these libraries as well.
